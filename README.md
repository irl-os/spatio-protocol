> A scalable, spatial-first transport protocol for the next generation of mixed reality applications.

## 🚀 Overview

Spatio Protocol is designed for the spatial computing era, providing native support for real-time spatial data transmission, multi-device coordination, and mixed reality experiences. Whether you're building AR applications, location-based games, or IoT networks, Spatio Protocol offers the tools you need for efficient spatial communication.

### Key Features

- 📍 **Native Spatial Addressing**: Purpose-built for 3D space and real-world coordinates
- 🔄 **Real-time State Synchronization**: Efficient updates for dynamic spatial environments
- 🔒 **Built-in Security**: End-to-end encryption and spatial authentication
- 🎮 **Device Agnostic**: From high-end AR headsets to simple IoT beacons
- 🌐 **Extensible**: Modular design supporting custom spatial types and behaviors
- ⚡ **Performance Focused**: Optimized for low-latency spatial interactions

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @spatioprotocol/core

# Using cargo
cargo add spatio-protocol

# Using pip
pip install spatio-protocol
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from spatio_protocol import SpatioNode, SpatialAddress

# Initialize a Spatio node
node = SpatioNode()

# Create a spatial address
address = SpatialAddress(
    position=(0, 0, 0),
    coordinate_system="cartesian"
)

# Start listening for spatial events
@node.on("spatial_event")
async def handle_event(event):
    print(f"Received event at {event.position}")

# Start the node
await node.start()
```
